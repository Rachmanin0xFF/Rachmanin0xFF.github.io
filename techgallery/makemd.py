Hi!

Below is a collection of images from (mostly personal) projects I've worked on over the years.
A few things to keep in mind:
1. This gallery is **not comprehensive**; I've done more than what's shown here.
2. It is biased towards projects that are visually interesting (so expect a disproportionate amount of computer graphics work).
3. This is an unordered collection (I sorted alphabetically by file name).
4. I'll try to make this page prettier soon, but I don't have time to muck with CSS right now.

There are 50-100 MB of images here, but they're set to `loading="lazy"`. I've tried to keep any wallpaper-worthy photos at their full 1920x1080 resolution. Enjoy!

    text_file.write(md_text)
