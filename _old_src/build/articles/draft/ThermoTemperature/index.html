This is a great way to explain why hot gas pushes outwards, or why hot water vaporizes.</p><p>This approximately-correct adage is fine, but I often observe the misconception that the <em>definition</em> of temperature is somehow tied to this cute proportionality. Consequently, the concept of <strong>negative temperatures</strong> can be extremely confusing to people not familiar to the field — negative kinetic energies don&#39;t make sense!</p><h2 id=okay-define-it-then>Okay, Define It, Then</h2><p>The temperature of a system with entropy \(S\) and energy \(U\) is: \[ T=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial U} \right)^{-1} \] That is, the reciporical of the rate of change of the system&#39;s entropy with respect to its energy.</p><h2 id=what>What</h2><p>That might be a lot to parse. Here&#39;s another way to state the equation (for positive temperatures):</p><ul><li><strong>Low temperature</strong> is when you add a little energy to your system and its entropy increases a <strong>lot</strong>.</li><li><strong>High temperature</strong> is when you add a little energy to your system and its entropy increases a <strong>little</strong>.</li></ul><p>In case you don&#39;t know, entropy is, loosely, &quot;the number of states a system&#39;s parts could be in given some of their net properties&quot; (multiplicity, \(\Omega\)). Actually, it&#39;s a constant times the logarithm of that (\(S = k \ln{(\Omega)})\) — more on why this is the case later.</p><h2 id=a-monoatomic-example>A Monoatomic Example</h2><p>We can think about number of possible arrangements of a system, \(\Omega\), as a function of energy, \(\Omega=\Omega(U)\). For example, if we know the kinetic energy of a single atom, then we know its velocity \(\vec{v}\) must rest on some <strong>spherical surface in the space of velocities</strong>. This is because knowing kinetic energy \( E=\frac{1}{2} m |\vec{v}|^2\) fixes the length of \(\vec{v}\), but not its direction. Specifically, \[ \Omega_\textrm{atom} \propto |\vec{v}|^2 \propto E_\textrm{atom}\] Because the surface area of a sphere is proportional to \(r^2\), energy is proportional to \(|\vec{v}|^2\), and here, \(r \propto v\).</p><p>So there is a linear relationship between an atom&#39;s energy and the number of velocities it can &#39;choose from&#39;. We can plot this:</p><div class=imblock><img src=graph1.png class=postim>It's not like there are really a "number" of possible velocities; the y-axis is more representative of the size of the continuous state space. Though in quantum systems, it really is finite.</div><h2 id=why-log-multiplicity>Why Log-Multiplicity?</h2><h2 id=stuff>Stuff</h2><p>The actual definition of temperature is predicated on this (true) fact:</p><ul><li>If two things are in contact and no heat is flowing between them, they are the same temperature.</li></ul><p>That is, the temperatures of two systems are equal in thermal equilibrium. So, to describe temperature, we&#39;re going to investigate the combination of two different systems, but eventually we will go back to just one.</p><p>Daniel Schroder&#39;s undergraduate textbook <em>An Introduction to Thermal Physics</em> has an excellent explanation of what I&#39;m about to describe in chapter 3, so I&#39;ll try to avoid rehashing his explanation.</p></section><div id=footer></div></div></section></div></body></html>
