## Q&A


## What is this?
My website! Check out the about page!

## Why did you make a website?
It lets me blog and serves as a convenient multimedia portfolio!

## Can you make me a website?
**NO!** I am not a web developer! Maybe I could make you something else, though.

## What are you?
I'm just a guy. I recently got my B.S. in physics, but I dabble in many things.

## Can I see your CV / Resume?
[Sure!](Adam_Resume_Sep_2024.pdf) This one should be mostly up-to-date, but it's very general. Contact me (adamlastowka@gmail.com) and I can give you a better, specialized one.

## Can I follow you on [platform]?
Absolutely: I've got a [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamlastowka), a [GitHub](https://github.com/Rachmanin0xFF), and a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-lastowka/). I'm also on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/adamlastowka.bsky.social).

## What tools are you using to make this website?
This is a [static website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) built from a collection of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files that are transformed into <code>.html</code> pages with a [very simple static site generator](https://github.com/Rachmanin0xFF/Rachmanin0xFF.github.io) I wrote. I am also using:

* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the website (for free!)
* [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/) to register <code>adamlastowka.com</code>
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for the interactive "applets" on the website
* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code syntax highlighting in articles
* [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to display LaTeX on pages
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) as a templating engine
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) for everything and [PIL/Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) for thumbnail gen
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my general-purpose IDE
* [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to edit most of the images on the website
