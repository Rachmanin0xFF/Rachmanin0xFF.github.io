    "#  \"Upgrading\" Florida Tech's CAPP Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam Lastowka\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Florida Tech's course catalog is pretty good. It's got nice hyperlinking, helpful popups, and a reliable search system. It even includes degree requirements for various majors. Let's see a screenshot:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"freshman_year.png\" width=800px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool! Not too hard to follow, and very nice and interactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if I want to check which of those degree requirements I'm meeting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Florida Tech's PAWS system for students has a handy tool just for that -- CAPP Reports (Curriculum, Advising, and Program Planning). Students can generate \"reports\" that tell them which requirements they need to meet / have met so far. Let's see how it looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"course_report.png\" width=800px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bleh. And this is just what I could fit in a screenshot -- these tables go on for pages. They aren't linked to the course catalog, so while planning courses, you need to have multiple tabs open while switching back and forth, double-checking that you entered the CRN right.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I'd like to have is something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.colorado.edu/aps/sites/default/files/block/astrophysics_flowchart.jpg\" width=800px>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a very visual person, a diagram like this one from UCol Boulder is what I need in order to properly think about my courses. The list in the course catalog is nice, but I like flowcharts -- especially ones that automatically track my progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I could just draw a flowchart for the Physics major. This would be simple and easy. Unfortunately, I am a computer programmer, and consequently duty-bound to automate any menial task I encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document I'll develop a procedure for transforming a CAPP report into a personalized, readable course dependency flowchart constructed from publicly available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need Florida Tech's course catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting the Catalog\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The course catalog does not have an API, and is stored in its entirety on a series of webpages found at https://catalog.fit.edu/content.php?catoid=12&navoid=551. Download the .html files of all 26 of these pages and save them.\n",
    "2. Combine the pages together. Open a linux shell (I'm on Windows, so I used WLS Ubuntu) and run `ls -tQ *.html | xargs cat > concat.html`\n",
    "3. This page contains the course names, but not their descriptions, which are only shown when a course name is clicked on. Thankfully, this page *does* contain links to individual course pages with these descriptions on them. This command extracts the links to these locations (first grep gets lines, second gets links, then sed removes those pesky \"amp;\"s):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    grep -e $'<td class=\\\"width\\\">.&nbsp;\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\\\"' concat.html | grep -Eo 'https://[^\\\"]+' | sed 's/\\&amp;/\\&/g' > links.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. We now have a list of links to every course description in the catalog (careful, these description pages can change frequently). Move `links.txt` to new, empty folder.\n",
    "5. Back in linux, run `wget -i links.txt` (sorry Florida Tech servers)\n",
    "6. Process the HTML files..."
