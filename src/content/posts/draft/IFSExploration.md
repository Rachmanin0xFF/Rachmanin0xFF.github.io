Let's play a game. Grab a sheet of paper and draw three dots on it.

<div class="imblock">
<img src="dots.png" class="postim"></img>

</div>

Let's say these three points are special, and use a different-colored marker from here on to signify that. Now, hover your marker over the top point, and move halfway towards one of the other two.
