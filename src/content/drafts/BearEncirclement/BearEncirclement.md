## Prologue: Sea Spray, Fear, Bears

[driving picture]

Windows down, midday, late July. I'm driving home from the Jersey shore with a friend. Abruptly, he says to me,

[talking picture, neither looking at each other]

"Hey, did you know that, technically, you're always surrounded by bears?"

[same pic, furrowed brow]

What? That doesn't make sense. No I'm not.

[pic again]

"Yeah, if you go far enough in any direction, eventually you'll hit a place with bears. So, bears on all sides. Surrounded. Weird, right?"

[confusion pic]

Weird?

[zoom on face]

No.

[zoom with "hey, was that our exit?" and zoom in on eyes with bear reflection in them]

If this was true, it was *terrifying*.

Are you afraid of bears? Not really? You grew up on Care Bears, Yogi, and Winnie the Pooh? I envy your complacency, but you have been sedated, protected from the terrible truth by a webwork of platitudes and propaganda.[^1] Did you know that bears eat their victims alive? Did you know your entire head can fit into a bear's mouth? Did you know that bears can muster ~1000 PSI[^2] of bite pressure? Did you know *you are actually very afraid of bears*?

I sped home and pulled out my laptop, mind racing, monomaniacally determined to answer one question: *was I always surrounded by bears*?

## A Distant Panopticon

Here are the rules:

1. The only "bear-free zones" are places where you are guaranteed to *never* find a bear.
2. To be "surrounded" means that walking a straight line (geodesic) in any direction, starting from you, will eventually land you in a "bear zone".
3. Your line-of-sight circles the planet: a bear a mile to your left counts as a bear 24,900 miles to your right.


[^1]: Okay, dropping the act for a second, bears are wonderful creatures. The majority of the eight existing bear species are under threat, consider making a donation to the [WWF](https://www.worldwildlife.org/) or another conservationist charity if you want to help them. That said, they are still *really freaking scary* when they're mad at you.

[^2]: [Polar bears](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2974639/), at least. [Brown bears](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11083096/) bite closer to 700 PSI.
