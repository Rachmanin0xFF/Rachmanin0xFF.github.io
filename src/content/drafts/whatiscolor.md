## The Tragedy

Imagine: some poor soul needs to repaint a section of their wall. In blissful ignorance, they whip out their cell phone and open "[Color Grab (color detection)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loomatix.colorgrab&hl=en_US)", a 4.5-star app with over a million downloads. They point their phone camera at the wall, and the app tells them it is "Galliano". *Oh, yes, Galliano,* they think, *this must be the color of my wall*.

This person is so, so wrong. The app is so, so wrong. Everything about this is so, so wrong. Let's talk about why.

## What is Light?

In reasonably fundamental terms, light is a bazillion little very fast-moving squiggles (I will not elaborate) called *photons*. Each photon has its own number that we call *energy*. For example, a white LED lightbulb emits about ten billion billion photons per second. Each of these photons has a different energy, which we can measure in units of electron-volts (eV). Most of the photons the lightbulb emits have energies between 2eV and 3eV. Because there are so many photons squiggling around, we typically don't worry about the energy of each individual photon. Instead, we consider the *spectrum* of photon energies. For example, this is the energy spectrum of sunlight at Earth's surface:
