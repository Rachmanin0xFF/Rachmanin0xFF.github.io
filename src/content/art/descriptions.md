When I went to [SRV](https://www.theschoolinrosevalley.org/about-srv/), the 3rd and 4th grade would participate in "the sword dance" -- a tweaked version of the Yorkshire [Long Sword dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Sword_dance). At the end of the dance, the kids would lock their wooden "swords" into a star shape and raise it up in the air. The younger classes would always wonder how the star stayed together. Tape? Rubber bands? Glue? For the uninitiated 3rd graders, the "secret of the star" became some clandestine, occult rumor that could only be found by participating in the dance.

My cousin was attending SRV virtually because of COVID-19, and wasn't able to participate in the sword dance, but she still wanted to know the "secret of the star", so I made this for her.
