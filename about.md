Hi! Welcome to my personal website.

I'm **Adam Lastowka**, a physics student who spends his spare time **developing games** and working on **computer science** projects. I also like to play the piano, draw, and think about fish. The photo on the left is second-grade me in a German salt mine.

I'm using [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/) to build the site, and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my HTML/CSS/JS editor.

The end result is a clean, lightweight, static website with very few dependencies. And I can write pages (like this one) in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)!

If you have any questions, issues with this site, or other inquiries, please direct them to adamlastowka@gmail.com.
