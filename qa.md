### What is this?
My website! Check out the about page!

### Why did you make a website?
So I could share all my dumb stuff with the world (or at least my family and friends).

### Can you make me a website?
**NO!** I am not a web developer!

### What are you, then?
I'm an undergraduate physics student.

### If you're a physics student, why aren't you posting about physics?
I've got a lot of different interests, and I do post about physics sometimes.

### Can I follow you on [platform]?
I've got a [twitter](https://twitter.com/adamlastowka), but that's about it.

### Why no JQuery/other JS stuff?
I am not a fan of web page bloat. I wanted this blog to be as minimalist as possible while still looking decent.

### Why JS stuff?
Okay, so I do use *some* JS for visual effects. But the site runs just fine with JS turned off, and I don't see the harm in a few bytes of JavaScript.

### How can I comment on your posts?
Currently, you can't (directly). There aren't many good, privacy-perserving static website comment hosting platforms out there. I want the site to remain privacy-friendly and ad-free. If there's a solution out there, feel free to let me know about it.
