Recall the first two requirements of "good" dither: isotropy and no low-frequency components. These two conditions are sufficient to describe the frequency-space (2D Fourier transform) representation of the dither itself


caveats:

blending

error lost to the void

kernels that don't sum to 1


palette selection:

k-means
gamut boundary
smooth convex surfaces and the failure of accuracy
component importance (prioritizing even luminosity spacing over chroma / hue)
