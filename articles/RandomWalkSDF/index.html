In this post, I want to highlight a lesser-known technique for solving PDEs that doesn&#39;t involve any linear algebra whatsoever.</p><h2 id=the-walk-on-spheres-or-circles-method>The Walk-on-Spheres (or Circles) Method</h2><p>The WoS method was <a href=https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-mathematical-statistics/volume-27/issue-3/Some-Continuous-Monte-Carlo-Methods-for-the-Dirichlet-Problem/10.1214/aoms/1177728169.full>introduced in 1956</a> as a method of solving the Laplace equation (\(\nabla^2 u = 0\)). The algorithm is a Monte Carlo method: it uses repeated random sampling to approximate a solution.</p><p>The method relies on the mean value property of the Laplace equation: to find the value of a solution at a point, just take the average of the values in a circle (or a solid disc, consequently) around it, provided all points on the circle are in the harmonic domain. Explicitly, for a harmonic function \(u(x,y)\) (one that solves \(\nabla^2 u = 0\)),</p><p>\[ u(x_0,y_0)=\frac{1}{2\pi R} \int_0^{2\pi} u(x+R\cos\theta, y+R\sin\theta)\ d\theta\]</p><p>This result generalizes to spheres/balls in \(n\) dimensions, but we&#39;ll stick to the 2D case here. Now, say we&#39;re given some domain \(\Omega\) with \(u(x,y)\) defined on its boundary, \(\partial\Omega\), and we&#39;re told the function is harmonic in \(\Omega\). Unless our domain is a perfect disc, the mean value property can&#39;t immediately tell us the value of \(u(x,y)\) anywhere in the domain. But we can do something a little clever.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at the problem. We&#39;re trying to find the value \(u(x_0, y_0)\), only knowing \(u\) on \(\partial \Omega\). We draw a circle around \((x_0, y_0)\):</p><div class=imblock><img src=shape_sto1s.png class=postim></div><p>If we knew all the values of \(u\) on the red circle, we could average them and easily find \(u(x_0, y_0)\). But we only know values of \(u\) on the boundary. Because we made the circle as large as we could, <em>part</em> of it is close (within some distance \(\epsilon\)) to the boundary, so at least we approximately know that fraction of the integral.</p><p>But for a statistically meaningful random sample over this circle, we&#39;ll need more than just that one point. Let&#39;s look at another point on the circle, \((x_1, y_1)\):</p><div class=imblock><img src=shape_sto2s.png class=postim></div><p>Again, the value at this point is equal to the average on a circle around it. The clever bit is that to find the value at \((x_1, y_1)\), we re-apply the mean value theorem, and randomly sample a circle at <em>that</em> point — the process becomes recursive.</p><div class=imblock><img src=shape_sto3s.png class=postim></div><p>So for each sample on our initial circle, we perform a random walk jumping between the surfaces of different spheres (hence the name). The loop terminates when we reach a point sufficiently close to the boundary, where \(u(x_n, y_n)\) is approximately equal to the value of \(u\) on the boundary. In pseudo-Python, the walk-on-spheres method looks like this:</p><pre><code class=language-python>get_function_in_boundary(x0, y0, sample_count)
    total = 0
    for i in range(sample_count):
        (x, y) = (x0, y0)
        while True:
            R = distance from (x, y) to boundary
            if R &lt; epsilon:
                total += boundary value near (x, y)
                break
            phi = random angle
            x += R*cos(phi)
            y += R*sin(phi)
    return total / sample_count

For a view of the front lines of its applications, have a look at <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/ >Keenan Krane&#39;s work</a>.</p><h2 id=the-tricky-bit>The Tricky Bit</h2><p>The pseudocode above is dead-simple to implement, save for one bit: computing the minimum distance from an arbitrary point \((x, y)\) to \(\partial \Omega\). The calculation of this value depends on how the boundary \(\partial \Omega\) is represented.</p><p>For now, I&#39;ll continue exploring the blob I&#39;ve been using in this article and the previous one:</p><div class=imblock><img src=shape.png class=postim></div><p>This is a binary image. To calculate distances to the binary boundary in the photo, we have two choices:</p><ol><li>Locate the boundary using edge detection and parameterize it (e.g. with line segments).</li><li>Work with the image directly. I&#39;ll continue to avoid any sort of meshing and choose the second option. We&#39;ll keep the image as a grid of pixels, and somehow come up with an algorithm that returns the distance from each pixel to the shape&#39;s boundary.</li></ol><h2 id=distance-fields>Distance Fields</h2><p>Distances to the boundary won&#39;t change, so we can precompute them and store them in a lookup table — a lookup <em>image</em> — where each pixel holds its distance to the nearest edge. In computer graphics, this sort of image is called a <em>distance field</em>. You can calculate these for \(n\) pixels with brute force (\(O(n^2)\)), use a &#39;flood&#39;-based approach and do it in \(O(n^{1.5})\), or use a sweet \(O(n\log_2(n))\) algorithm developed by <a href=https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tants/jfa/i3d06.pdf>Rong and Tan in 2006</a> called &quot;Jump Flooding&quot;.
