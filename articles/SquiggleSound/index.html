This works very well, but it is a pain to do, enough so that hardly anyone ever writes their own implementation of it. FEA packages (FEniCS, MOOSE, NASTRAN, etc.) are often powerful, bulky libraries that work well and are much more than we need for this simple problem. Time to take a step back.</p><h2 id=math-review>Math Review</h2><p>We&#39;re looking for solutions to the wave equation:</p><p>\[ \nabla^2 u = \frac{1}{c^2}u_{tt} \]</p><p>on a surface \( \Omega \) with the function constrained to zero on its boundary (\( u(\partial \Omega, t) = 0 \)). Because we&#39;re interested in time-independent solutions, we suppose that \(u(x, y, t)\) is seperable in time; i.e. that:</p><p>\[ u(x, y, t)=U(x,y)T(t) \implies \frac{T&#39;&#39;}{c^2 T} = \frac{\nabla^2 U}{U} = -\lambda^2\]</p><p>\(T(t)\) is just a sinusoid, leaving us with the eigenvalue problem:</p><p>\[ \nabla^2 U = -\lambda^2 U\]</p><p>This is called the Helmholtz equation, and solving it amounts to finding the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator (\(\nabla^2\)). This means that in order to find our resonant modes, we only need to:</p><ol><li>Find a way to represent functions on our region as vectors.</li><li>Represent the Laplace operator (acting on our region) as a matrix.</li><li>Find the eigenvectors &amp; eigenvalues of that matrix.</li></ol><p>The eigenfunctions \(\{U_i\}\) will be the resonant mods, while the square roots of the eigenvalues \(\{\lambda_i\}\) will be proportional to their respective modes&#39; oscillating frequencies.</p><h2 id=digital-frontier>Digital Frontier</h2><p>The math so far has been method-agnostic; we&#39;re still free to use the FEM at this point. But the blob I drew earlier suggests another option: it exists on a grid of pixels. We can choose to represent functions on the blob as vectors, where each entry corresponds to the function&#39;s value at a different pixel in the photo. This is the foundation of the finite difference (FD) method; a precursor to the FEM. While the FEM is, ultimately, faster and more accurate, the FD method is far easier to implement and debug.</p><p>First of all, we&#39;ll need maps that take us from pixels to vector indices and vice versa. I&#39;ll use Python:</p><pre><code class=language-python>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from PIL import Image

# Get rid of any aliasing in the blob image
binary_image = np.array(Image.open('blob.png').convert('1'))

# This will contain the associated pixel coords for each vector entry
interior_index = []

# This will contain the vector entry index for each pixel (init to -1)
grid_index = -np.ones(binary_image.shape, dtype=np.int32)
ii = 0
for ix, iy in np.ndindex(binary_image.shape):
    # Only include a pixel in our vector if it's within the blob
    if binary_image[ix][iy]:
        interior_index.append((ix, iy))
        grid_index[ix, iy] = ii
        ii += 1
interior_index = np.array(interior_index)

# Look at what we did
grid_index = np.ma.masked_where(~binary_image, grid_index)
plt.imshow(grid_index)

cbar.set_label("Index in vector")
plt.show()
</code></pre><div class=imblock><img src=indices.png class=postim></div>Next, we need to figure out what the Laplace operator looks like when applied to one of these 28465-dimensional vectors.<p>Let&#39;s think intuitively. The Laplace operator \(\nabla^2 U = U_{xx}+U_{yy}\) is a measure of <em>curvature</em>. Locally, curvature is how much the average value of a point&#39;s neighbors differ from that point. So, to find the curvature at a specific pixel (and thus a specific vector entry), we subtract the average of the values at the pixel&#39;s neighbors from the pixel&#39;s own value:</p><p>\[ \nabla^2 U(x, y) \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}U(x,y) - \frac{1}{4\epsilon^2}\big[U(x+\epsilon, y)+U(x-\epsilon, y)+U(x,y+\epsilon)+U(x, y-\epsilon)\big] \]</p><p>Where \( \epsilon \) is the spacing between adjacent pixels. Wonderfully, this per-pixel operation is linear, and nothing stops us from putting it in matrix form:</p><pre><code class=language-python>epsilon = 1.0/100.0 # A pixel is 1/100th of a... unit? It's all arbitrary.

FD_matrix = np.zeros((interior_index.shape[0], interior_index.shape[0]))
for (ix, iy) in interior_index:
    this_i = grid_index[ix, iy]
    r_i = grid_index[ix+1, iy]
    l_i = grid_index[ix-1, iy]
    u_i = grid_index[ix, iy+1]
    d_i = grid_index[ix, iy-1]
    if r_i > 0:
        FD_matrix[this_i][r_i] -= 1
    if l_i > 0:
        FD_matrix[this_i][l_i] -= 1
    if u_i > 0:
        FD_matrix[this_i][u_i] -= 1

    FD_matrix[this_i][this_i] += 4
FD_matrix *= 0.25/(epsilon*epsilon)

We&#39;re also primarily interested in the lower-energy modes (larger patterns), so we&#39;ll specify that by setting <code>which='SM'</code>.</p><pre><code class=language-python>from scipy.sparse import csc_matrix

For the first few harmonics, the margin of error was consistently less than 0.1%.</p><h2 id=damping>Damping</h2><p>The solutions we&#39;ve found assume that our membrane is perfect; i.e. that it does not lose energy. This isn&#39;t good: even if it was physically possible, it would imply that we couldn&#39;t hear the drum (as it isn&#39;t emitting any energy in the form of sound). Thankfully, it isn&#39;t that difficult to introduce a damping term into the wave equation:</p><p>\[ \frac{1}{c^2}u_{tt} = \nabla^2 u - \beta u_t \implies T&#39;&#39; + c^2\beta T&#39; + \lambda^2 c^2 T = 0\]</p><p>The resulting equation in \(t\) represents a damped harmonic oscillator, and the only real change is that our time-solutions get a shifted natural frequency and an exponential decay term: \[T_\lambda(t)\propto\exp\left(-\frac{\beta c^2}{2} t\right) \cos\left(\frac{c\sqrt{4\lambda^2 - c^2 \beta^2}}{2} t - \phi_\lambda \right) \]</p><p>Where \( \phi_\lambda \) is some phase angle depending on our initial conditions. If we let \( \alpha = c\beta/2 \), the final equation cleans up nice: \[T_\lambda(t)\propto e^{-\alpha c t} \cos\left[\sqrt{\lambda^2 - \alpha^2}\ c t - \phi_\lambda\right] \]</p><h2 id=striking-the-shape>Striking the Shape</h2><p>The Laplace operator is symmetric, so its eigenfunctions should be orthogonal. This means that determining the coefficients of some distortion (e.g. one made by a mallet) on our membrane is as simple as performing a series of inner products. Specifically, any state our membrane might take \( f(x,y) \) can be written using a Fourier expansion of the membrane&#39;s normalized basis modes \(\{ U_i\}\):</p><p>\[ f(x,y)=\sum_k c_k\ U_k(x, y),\ \ c_k=\int_\Omega U_k(x, y) f(x, y)\ dx\ dy \]</p><p>If we let our mallet whack the membrane with a Dirac delta function, \(f(x,y) = \delta(x-x_0,y-y_0)\), we can avoid computing the integral on the right, and just select values from \(\{ U_i\}\) at \((x_0, y_0)\). Doing this with the first hundred harmonics shows Airy disc-esque patterns on the membrane:</p><div class=imblock><img src=airy.png class=postim></div><p>To remove the (unphysical) ringing artifacts, we can apply a low pass filter to the spectrum (\(G\propto 1/f \)):</p><div class=imblock><img src=noairy.png class=postim></div><p>Despite feeling a little dirty, this works, and it runs quickly.</p><h2 id=listening>Listening</h2><p>We know the eigenmodes and their frequencies, and we can find their amplitudes (given a &#39;mallet&#39; strike location).
